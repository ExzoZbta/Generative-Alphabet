## Generative Typography
---

Overview
--------
This was my final project for ART 132 (Intro to Graphic Design), where I was required to design a font and a poster with a simple message using that font.
  - After my experience with making generative art for the first time in CPSC 334, I was curious to explore the process of generative art in a more 'official' art context. This project prompt was the perfect time to satiate that curiosity.

  - Using p5.js, I applied Perlin noise (which I discovered in CPSC 334, as well) to the construction and shape of the capital letters of 'Helvetica.' Each letter is constantly transforming and reiterating its shape and contour.

Usage
--------
- Each letter has a corresponding folder containing what's needed to run the letter's animation on your preferred web browser.

- Example: [A-folder](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/Generative-Alphabet/tree/main/A-folder)
    - [index.html](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/Generative-Alphabet/blob/main/A-folder/index.html): double-clicking on this file will load the letter on your preferred web browser.
      - Hit F11 to make the browser window fullscreen.
    - [sketch.js](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/Generative-Alphabet/blob/main/A-folder/sketch.js): the code for loading the base Helvetica font and drawing the letter.
    - [style.css](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/Generative-Alphabet/blob/main/A-folder/style.css): styling for index.html on the web browser.
    - [Helvetica.tff](https://github.com/ExzoZbta/Generative-Alphabet/blob/main/A-folder/Helvetica.ttf): Helvetica font framework distributed through p5.js.
