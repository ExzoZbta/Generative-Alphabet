## Generative Typography
---

Overview
--------
This was my final project for ART 132 (Intro to Graphic Design), where I was required to design a font and a poster with a simple message using that font.
  - After my experience with making generative art for the first time in CPSC 334, I was curious to explore the process of generative art in a more 'official' art context. This project prompt was the perfect time to satiate that curiosity.

  - Using p5.js, I applied Perlin noise (which I discovered in CPSC 334, as well) to the construction and shape of the capital letters of 'Helvetica.'
